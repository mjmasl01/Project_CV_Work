Recap of Ymin and Ymax from Normal Population (Class simulation and prep task)
```{r}
n = 5             # sample size
mu = 10           # population mean
sigma = 2         # population standard deviation
nsim = 5000       # number of simulations (samples to generate)

my.mins = numeric(nsim)     # a place to store my sample minimums
my.maxs = numeric(nsim)     # a place to store my sample maximums

for (i in 1:nsim)
{
  my.sample = round( rnorm(n,mu,sigma) , 2)   # take a sample from my population
  # note that you can calculate both of the desired statistics for each sample generated
  my.mins[i] = min(my.sample)                 # compute the min from the sample
  my.maxs[i] = max(my.sample)                 # compute the max from the sample
}

hist(my.mins, xlab=expression("Y"[min]), main=paste("Sampling Distribution of the\n Sample Min when n = ",n))
hist(my.maxs, xlab=expression("Y"[max]), main=paste("Sampling Distribution of the\n Sample Max when n = ",n))

mean(my.mins)
mean(my.maxs)

var(my.mins)
var(my.maxs)
