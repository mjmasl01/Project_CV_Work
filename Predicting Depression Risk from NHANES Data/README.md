## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict depression risk using data from the 2021–2023 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). Two key self-reported depression indicators from the PHQ-9 screener (DPQ020 and DPQ060) are modeled using **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost**, with **SMOTE** applied to address class imbalance.

The project integrates behavioral, socioeconomic, and clinical features (e.g., sleep, income, CRP, Vitamin D) and explores explainability using **SHAP values**.

## Objectives

- Predict binary depression indicators (DPQ020 and DPQ060)
- Compare **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost**
- Test the effect of **SMOTE** vs. native class weighting
- Interpret feature importance using **SHAP**

## Methodology

- Data merged from 10+ NHANES modules: demographics, income, sleep, alcohol, physical activity, clinical labs
- Invalid responses removed (codes: 7, 9, 77, 99, 9999, etc.)
- Binary targets:
  - `DPQ020_binary`: Felt down, depressed, or hopeless
  - `DPQ060_binary`: Felt bad about yourself
- Models trained:
  - Logistic Regression (`class_weight='balanced'`)
  - XGBoost (`scale_pos_weight`)
  - Both also trained with **SMOTE**
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
  - 5-fold Cross-Validation
  - SHAP value visualizations
  - Validation Curves (hyperparameter tuning)

## Results Summary

| Target        | Model              | Accuracy | Recall (Depressed) | SHAP Top Features                    |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| DPQ020        | Logistic Regression | 62%     | 0.69                | Age, Sleep, Income, CRP, Vitamin D   |
|               | XGBoost            | 65%     | 0.38                | Age, HbA1c, CRP, Income              |
| DPQ060        | Logistic Regression | 66%     | 0.65                | Age, CRP, Sleep, Income              |
|               | XGBoost            | 69%     | 0.27                | Age, Sleep, Vitamin D, HbA1c         |

## Interpretation

- **Logistic Regression** offered better sensitivity (recall) for detecting depression cases.
- **XGBoost** performed slightly better on overall accuracy but struggled with minority class recall.
- **SHAP analysis** identified consistent predictors: age, income, CRP (inflammation), and sleep patterns.

---

## Limitations

- Targets based on **self-reported** PHQ-9 symptoms, not clinical diagnoses
- NHANES is **cross-sectional**, limiting temporal prediction
- No external validation set used
- SMOTE helped but could introduce synthetic overfitting if not validated properly
