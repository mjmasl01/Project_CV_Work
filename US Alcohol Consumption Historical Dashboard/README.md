## 🧾 Overview

This was a fun college project built with **R** and **Shiny** that lets users explore alcohol consumption patterns across the United States. Users can interactively visualize per capita consumption of **Beer**, **Wine**, **Spirits**, or **All Types** of alcoholic beverages across time and states.

Depending on your selection, the app dynamically switches between:

- **Bar Plots**: When viewing "All States"
- **Line Graphs**: When selecting individual or multiple states

## 📊 Features

- Choose alcohol type: `Beer`, `Wine`, `Spirits`, or `All Types`
- Compare across all 50 states or just a few
- Toggle organization and sorting: by `State` or `Consumption`, in ascending/descending order
- Built with `ggplot2`, `tidyverse`, and `plotly` (optional for later enhancement)
